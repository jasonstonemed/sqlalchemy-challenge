# I had issues with importing flask and then numpy, although both were in my environments: base, main, and PythonData. Both had been uninstalled/reinstalled and conda was updated. With assistance, flask was installed successfully. However, flask appeared to affect numpy import and it was never successfully imported. Code was run via git bash 'python app.py.'
